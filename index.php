              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <h2>Where I Grew Up</h2>
              <p>My name is Preston Blaylock. I grew up in Rexburg Idaho. I am the third oldest of six kids, two brother and three sisters. I love my family very much they are my best friends. I enjoy web development, playing guitar, piano, photography, and being with people.</p>
              <h2>About My Mission</h2>
              <p>
The greatest thing that I have ever done in my life is serve a mission. I served in the Oklahoma Tulsa Mission, OTM. We call it the only true mission. The mission really helped me out a lot. I was a really shy, insecure kid before the mission. The mission taught me a lot. It taught me that I could do tough things. I gained a lot of self confidence and met a lot of good people on my mission. </p>
              <h2>About My Major</h2>
              <p>I am a senior studying Computer Information Technology with a minor in Web Design, and I absolutely love it. Growing up I would have never guessed that I would be working with computers. I was really a lost soul after my mission, and I was just taking classes to find out what I wanted to do. I took a programming class from Brother Barzee a CIT teacher. I loved it so much that is when I decided that I would do programming, and web development. </p>
